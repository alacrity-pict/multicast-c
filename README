Multicast Program in C :-

1. msender.c 
	This program sends datagram messages to a group.

2. mreceiver.c
	This program receives and displays the message sent by the sender to the group.

The group ip is "226.1.2.3".
We have kept it static right now but the program can be modified to make it dynamic.
The program has been checked on a single machine and it works.
We'll check it on multiple machines and upload the results soon.
